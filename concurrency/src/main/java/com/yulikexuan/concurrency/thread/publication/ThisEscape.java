/**
 * ThisEscape
 * <p/>
 * Implicitly allowing the <code>this</code> reference to escape
 * Donâ€™t do this
 *
 * This class shows a mechanism by which an object or its internal state can be
 * published is to publish an inner class instance
 *
 * When the inner EventListener instance is published, so is the enclosing
 * ThisEscape instance
 *
 * Publishing an object from within its constructor can publish an incompletely
 * constructed object
 *
 * If the <code>this</code> reference escapes during construction, the object
 * is considered not properly constructed
 *
 * Do not allow the this reference to escape during construction
