## Safe Publication Idioms

1. To publish an object safely, both the reference to the object and the 
   objectâ€™s state must be made visible to other threads at the same time
   
   A properly constructed object can be safely published by:

    - Initializing an object reference from a static initializer
      - ``` public static Holder holder = new Holder(42); ```
    
    - Storing a reference to it into a volatile field or AtomicReference
      
    - Storing a reference to it into a final field of a properly constructed object
      
    - Storing a reference to it into a field that is properly guarded by a lock
        - the thread-safe library collections offer safe publication guarantees
        - Other handoff mechanisms in the class library (such as ``` Future ``` and 
          ``` Exchanger ```) also constitute safe publication


2. To share mutable objects safely, they must be safely published and be either 
   thread-safe or guarded by a lock 

   The publication requirements for an object depend on its mutability:
     - Immutable objects can be published through any mechanism
     - Effectively immutable objects must be safely published
     - Mutable objects must be safely published, and must be either threadsafe 
       or guarded by a lock


## Sharing Objects Safely

  - When you publish an object, you should document how the object can be 
    accessed, ask yourself:
      - What you are allowed to do with it 
      - Do you need to acquire a lock before using it
      - Are you allowed to modify its state, or only to read it


  - The most useful policies for using and sharing objects in a concurrent 
    program are:
    - __Thread-Confined__ : 
      A thread-confined object is owned exclusively by and confined to one 
      thread, and can be modified by its owning thread
    - __Shared Read-Only__ : 
      A shared read-only object can be accessed concurrently by multiple threads 
      without additional synchronization, but cannot be modified by any thread
      - Shared read-only objects include immutable and effectively immutable 
        objects
    - __Shared Thread-Safe__ : 
      A thread-safe object performs synchronization internally, so multiple 
      threads can freely access it through its public interface without further 
      synchronization
    - __Guarded__ A guarded object can be accessed only with a specific lock 
      held  
      - Guarded objects include those that are encapsulated within other 
        thread-safe objects and published objects that are known to be guarded 
        by a specific lock
